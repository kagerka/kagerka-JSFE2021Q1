            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">There are two species of gorilla, each containing two subspecies.
              The two species are eastern and western, and the four sub-species are <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_River_gorilla" class="text-link">Cross River</a> and <a

              sub-species of the Western species) and Grauerâs and Mountain (are sub-species of the Eastern species).
              Western gorillas can be distinguished from other gorilla <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Description" target="_blank"
                class="text-link">subspecies</a> by their brownish-gray hair, auburn-colored crests and overall smaller
              size. Eastern gorillas tend to be black in color and larger in size. In all gorillas, males develop silver
              coloration along their backs as they mature. The species is diurnal, which means they are active during
              the day, and of all the great apes, gorillas are the most terrestrial. This means that they primarily live
              on the ground, although they do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Ecology"
                target="_blank" class="text-link">occasionally climb trees</a> to feed and nest. They are also able to
              stand on two legs for short periods of time.</p>
            <h3 class="animal-info__complete-info_title">Physical features and characteristics:</h3>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Gorillas are the largest of all primates and reach physical
              maturity between 12 and 15 years of age. Males can be between 350 and 450 pounds, almost twice as much as
              females, weighing in between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Description"
                target="_blank" class="text-link">150</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Description" target="_blank"
                class="text-link">250</a> pounds. Males stand between 5.5 to 6 feet tall. Females are a bit smaller,
              standing between 4â7â to 4â11â. The malesâ heads are large and pointed due to the sagittal crest that
              forms the back of the top of the head. This crest serves as the foundation for attachment of a great
              number of jaw muscle fibers, which allows for the chewing power needed to process tough vegetation.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">The vision and perception of western lowland gorillas is similar
              to that of humans. Gorillas have a prominent brow ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same as
              humans. The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The wrinkles on a gorillaâs nose, known as a noseprint, are
              like human fingerprints, and every individualâs noseprint is unique. Researchers use these noseprints as
              identification markers in their studies, both in zoological settings and in the wild.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp canines used for defense
              and breaking through vegetation. Their molars have complicated patterns of cups and ridges that facilitate
              chewing of tough plant fibers.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Gorillasâ faces, hands, and feet are bare, but the rest of their
              bodies are covered with short, thin hair. Gorilla hands and feet are large, with leathery palms and soles,
              and broad, flat nails Their hands are very dexterous and can pick up small, delicate objects. Like their
              hands, their feet have opposable thumbs and toes. Like all apes, gorillasâ arms are longer than their
              legsâa feature that allows them to walk on all fours. They are called âknuckle-walkers,â meaning that they
              walk on the knuckles of their forelimbs and the soles of their hind limbs. This form of locomotion
              develops calluses on the knuckles, preserving the sensitivity of the fingertips necessary for <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Intelligence" target="_blank"
                class="text-link">manipulating</a> smaller objects.</p>
            <h3 class="animal-info__complete-info_title">Lifestyle and reproduction:</h3>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Gorillas tend to be shy, peaceful creatures; they are not
              normally aggressive to other animals unless provoked. However, if they are provoked, they can be
              dangerous. They can demonstrate aggression by charging towards perceived intruders. Typically, they will
              not actually hit the intruder, but rush past, turn and then charge again.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text animal-info__complete-info_text-list">Gorillas use a combination
              of vocalizations, visual signals and scents to communicate. They are considered relatively quiet compared
              to other primates, but do have at least <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Conservation" target="_blank"
                class="text-link">25 recognized</a> vocalizations, including:</p>
            <ul class="animal-info__complete-info_text animal-info__complete-info_list">
              <li>Hooting: Can carry for a mile through the forest and is usually accompanied by display behavior such
                as chest beating, strutting, and vegetation slapping</li>
              <li>Screams: Sounds of alarm or warning</li>
              <li>Belches: Deep rumblings of contentment, comfort, or well-being</li>
              <li>Sharp Grunts: Used when discipline is required</li>
              <li>Whoop Barks: High-pitched barks denote curiosity</li>
              <li>Bark Grunt: Aggression</li>
              <li>Chuckles: Playfulness</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Infants have three distinct vocalizations; these are similar to
              the cries of a human baby. They will typically cry when hurt or frightened, resulting in an immediate
              response from the mother.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Dominant males also have a distinctive smell that they use to
              communicate with other troops and to maintain contact with their own troop. Perhaps the most recognizable
              behavior performed by gorillas is chest-beating. It is primarily done by male gorillas at the end of a
              display meant to intimidate intruding males or predators. The sound can be heard for long distances.
              Females will chest-beat infrequently; they will typically beat their hands against the insides of their
              thighs. Chest-beating can also indicate playful behavior, however, especially in the young. Young gorillas
              play much like humans do, playing tag and doing somersaults.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Western lowland gorillas live in family groups known as troops.
              These troops can consist of 5 to 30 individuals, although the average size is 11. The group is led by a
              dominant silverback male and contains several adult females and their young. The females will typically
              bond with the silverback, but not necessarily with each other. The silverback will remain dominant for as
              long as he can defeat competing males.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">There are several younger, blackback males that remain in the
              group until they are capable of challenging the silverback. These young males are often driven out of the
              troop to live a solitary life or to live in a smaller group with other bachelors until they establish
              their own troops. If a dominant silverback is displaced, the new dominant male will typically kill the
              infants in the troop, sending the females prematurely into reproductive cycling. This increases the maleâs
              chances of siring offspring, as his time as the dominant male is uncertain. As such, females consider a
              maleâs ability to fight paramount to their offspringâs survival.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">On maturing, females will also leave their natal group to join a
              lone male or another small group. This is vital to prevent inbreeding and to protect the gene pool.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Nesting typically occurs in the late afternoon, with the gorillas
              bedding down for the night at sundown. The females and their offspring will build nests of leaves and
              branches, while the dominant silverback will settle at the base of the tree, in order to protect his
              family. At Zoo Atlanta, while the gorillas are outside, their indoor areas are thoroughly cleaned; the
              walls and floors are scrubbed with <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_lowland_gorilla#Relationship_with_humans" target="_blank"
                class="text-link">disinfectant</a>. The gorillas are offered hay in their indoor area at night and nest
              with this material, replicating natural behavior.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">In a troop, the single silverback male will mate with the
              females, siring all the offspring of the troop. Females generally reach reproductive maturity between 7
              and 8 years of age, with males reaching maturity later, around 10 years of age, due to competition. The
              potential breeding season is year-round and gestation typically takes 256 days, or about 8.5 months. Labor
              can last anywhere from one to 4 hours. Babies are usually born singly; twins are rare. Newborns weigh
              between 3 and 5 pounds and are weaned around 2 to 3 years of age, but can be dependent on their mothers
              for up to 4 years. The average interval between births for a female gorilla is four to six years.</p>

            <h3 class="animal-info__complete-info_title">Habitat:</h3>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, lush tropical forest of
              west and central Africa. The herbs, shrubs and vines that make up its diet grow best where the open canopy
              allows plenty of light to reach the forest floor. These tropical forests also contain a much higher
              diversity of arboreal substrates and foods, in particular fruit, than mountainous habitats. Western
              lowland gorillas live primarily on the ground and build sleeping nests on the ground or in the trees for
              the night.</p>
            <h3 class="animal-info__complete-info_title">Diet:</h3>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on
              plant parts including seeds, leaves, stems, shoots, roots and flowers; however, they prefer fruit whenever
              itâs in season. Occasionally they will eat insects, such as termites or ants, as a supplement to their
              diet when they are readily available. Due to their dietary preferences, western lowland gorillas spend a
              lot of their time in and around trees, especially fruit trees. Even large males can sometimes be found up
              in the trees, but they are careful to stay near a main trunk or on larger branches that are able to
              support their weight. Younger, lighter gorillas may climb higher in trees, even swinging freely from
              branch to branch. Gorillas never completely strip vegetation from a single area; rather, the rapid
              regrowth of the vegetation they consume allows them to stay within a reasonable confined home range for
              extended periods of time.</p>
            <p class="animal-info__complete-info_text">Here at Zoo, we provide a medley of fruits and vegetables to our
              western lowland gorillas. These include apples, oranges, bananas, raisins, sweet potatoes, cabbage,
              collards, and primate chow. In the morning, vegetables and fruit are chopped up and scattered around the
              habitat. From there, the gorillas come outside and forage for their food as they would in the wild. Browse
              foods including bamboo, banana leaves, mulberry, elm and willow are also <a
